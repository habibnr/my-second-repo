    <p>In conclusion
        No matter, if your cat is peeing on your bed, it's important to take them to the vet so they can rule out any medical causes. If the vet gives them a clean bill of health, you can start to look at other reasons for their behavior. If everything is OK, Then your cats will be fine.
